# About this project

This project is currently in development, and forms part of my Final Year Project for my Undergraduate degree.

This software is currently in a prototype state, however, will be completed over the next few months.

When completed, this software will be a simulation environment tool that allows Architects and other AEC professionals to 
perform crowd evacuation simulations on architectural models imported from Autodesk Revit.
From these simulations, the software allows for easy visualisation of metrics such as foot traffic, congestion, stampedes, and panic.

The goal of the project is to allow the user to measure evacuation performance of buildings, identify bottlenecks in building layouts,
iteratively test models, and communicate the impact of their design decisions.

## AEC Integration
This software uses [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) - an open-source AEC platform that allows for interoperability between popular AEC 3D formats.
Currently, the focus for this project is to support the Autodesk Revit platform,
However, because of Speckle's support for other AEC programs such as Dynamo, Grasshopper, Rhino, AutoCAD, and Civil 3D, there is potential for these platforms to also work, (Currently Untested).
